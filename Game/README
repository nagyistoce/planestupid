Notes:
The whole Game.Ui namespace is sort of a mess, i will clean it up in due time; if you'd
like to use that part of the source, just be careful and don't borrow it with my mistakes.

Bugs:
none that i can specifically point out atm, though i'm aware that the game *does* occasionaly
crash or freeze for no apparent reason.
